For instance, let’s say you are considering a temperature field. Every point in space has its own temperature attached to it. Now the gradient operator associates to each point a vector, based on the variation of the temperature around it.

    "\n",
    "The reason why a wrong step size could cause problems is that if the gradient changes rapidly, the gradient a few steps away would probably be completely different from its current value. We don’t necessarily mind the gradient becoming slightly different. What concerns us is whether the sign of the gradient is the same. If we take a step that is too large, we could end up actually increasing the loss. The ideal step size for each eigenvector component is when x converges to 0 in one step. Therefore, it is 𝛼=1𝜆𝑖.\n",
    "\n",
    "If all the eigenvalues are the same, choosing the step-size is trivial. The problem is when the eigenvalues are very different. In this case, we have to be careful not to allow any of the components to diverge: this means that the step-size is effectively bounded by the largest curvature = largest eigenvalue. On the other hand, the speed of convergence is determined by the smallest eigenvalue. This is why the ratio between the largest and smallest eigenvalues in the Hessian is a very important value and has its own name: the “condition number”. The problem of the condition number being very large is called “ill-conditioning”, and is a prevalent problem in many areas of optimization. "
